componentDidMount() {
    const cartJSON = localStorage.getItem('cart');
    const cart = JSON.parse(cartJSON);
    this.setState({
        items: ['shoes', 'sandals', 'hat', 'sunglasses']
        cart: cart || [] //so that when the cart isn't there it doesn't give an error
    })
}
    

addToCart = (item)



stringify to serialize date (turn it into a string)

parse it to deserialize and re-use the data again

application tab in inspect has local localStorage

use localStorage.setItem('cart', JSON.stringify(cart))
)

to clarify: localStorage.setItem('your-item', JSON.stringify(your-item)

GET ITEM 

localstorage.getItem(key)

if from some service you use, you would use:
yourservice.shoppingItems()  where "yourservice" is the name of the service


TO STUDY
callbacks
& 
promises (.then & .catch)
&
async await


requesting data from another source:

export const getItems = async () => {
    const response = await fetch("url")
    return response.json()  // this (".json") does the parsing for you
}

Fetch 

https://mysterious-savannah-64434.herokuapp.com/items   

"/items" is the path that we go into from the URL we're given to get the data that we want
    could also be items/somethingelse (if I want to get a specific item in that dataset)
